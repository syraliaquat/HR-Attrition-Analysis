# HR-Attrition-Analysis
##Project Background
This project focuses on analyzing employee attrition within an organization to understand the factors contributing to employee turnover. The company operates in a competitive industry and has been in operation for several years, with a business model that relies heavily on maintaining a skilled and motivated workforce. As a data analyst, the goal is to identify key trends in employee attrition and provide actionable insights to improve retention strategies.
##Data Structure
The dataset used for this analysis includes various attributes related to employee performance, job roles, education, gender, and age groups. The data is structured with multiple columns representing different employee attributes and rows corresponding to individual employee records. The dataset was analyzed using a dashboard tool to visualize key metrics and trends.
##Executive Summary
Overview of Findings
•	Total Attrition Rate: The organization has an attrition rate of 49%, with a significant number of employees leaving due to various factors.
•	Performance Impact: High-performing employees constitute a larger portion of the workforce (73 employees) compared to low-performing employees (19 employees).
•	Job Role Attrition: Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists have the highest attrition rates, indicating potential issues in these roles.
•	Education and Gender: Employees with Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees are more likely to leave, and there is a notable gender disparity in attrition rates.
##Visualizations
The dashboard includes visualizations such as bar charts and pie charts to represent attrition rates by job role, education, gender, and age groups. These visualizations help in quickly identifying key areas of concern.
##Insights Deep Dive
•	Work Alliance: Employees who feel "Very Far" or "Far" from the organization's goals have higher attrition rates, suggesting a need for better alignment and communication.
•	Age and Gender: Younger employees and certain gender groups show higher attrition rates, indicating potential issues with workplace culture or career development opportunities.
•	Education Level: Employees with higher education levels (Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees) are more likely to leave, possibly due to a lack of career advancement opportunities.
##Recommendations

2.	Career Development: Provide clear career paths and development opportunities, especially for highly educated employees.
3.	Retention Strategies for Key Roles: Focus on retention strategies for Laboratory Technicians and Research Scientists, such as competitive compensation and job satisfaction initiatives.
4.	Workplace Culture: Address potential cultural issues that may be contributing to higher attrition rates among younger employees and specific gender groups.
